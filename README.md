# NewPipe-Dev-Releases
New features merged together to make new features available before final release. These are not official releases, and are not maintained by the NewPipe team. They are simply preview builds of potential features and fixes.

Find releases on the release page [here](https://github.com/PeterHindes/NewPipe-Dev-Releases/releases)

Source Zips will be empty, as this repo has no source code. Pull requests will be linked in the release text.
